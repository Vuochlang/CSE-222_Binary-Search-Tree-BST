# CSE-222-Introduction-to-Data-Structure
# Programming Assignment: Binary-Search-Tree-BST

In C, build a database of license plates and names using a binary search tree (BST). 

_ This code will implement a Binary Tree which is a tree data structure. 

_Each node will have two children as the maximum number.

_The to children are referred to the left child (left-sub-tree) and the right child (right-sub-tree). 

_This code will allow user to

    _dump data out in LNR, NLR LRN order

    _check the height of the tee
    
    _check if the tree is balanced

    _delete any node (platenumber and its information) from the tree
